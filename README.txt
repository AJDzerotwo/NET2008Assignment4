LrgstSubArr is an interactive command line app which generates an array of numbers
of a length chosen by the user, and then finds the contiguous subarray within the
original array whose contents have the highest sum. It then prints the original array,
the subarray, and the sum of all the numbers within the subarray.

Because it requires user input from the command line, it should be run with:

docker run -i -t ajdzerotwo/python-lrgst-sub-arr

You will be prompted for input.
